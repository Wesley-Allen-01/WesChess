# WesChess

WesChess is an online web platform for people to play chess against their peers in real time over the internet. It was developed by two CU Computer Science students: Wesley Allen and Will Van Vuuren. Both of us are avid chess players and were inspired to complete this project when we learned that the chess platform [Lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila) was created by one sole developer. 

This project utilized the following technologies
* Backend: Go programming language with Gin web framework and Gorilla Websockets
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, chess.js, and chessboard.js
* Database: SQLite
* Deployment: Render

In order to maintain a connection between players with minimal latency, we utilized WebSockets which provided a full-duplex communication channel between players. For any inquiries regarding this project, reach out to Wesley.Allen-1@colorado.edu and/or William.VanVuuren@colorado.edu.
